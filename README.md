# URL Listen

Super simple app to listen for POST requests and open the URL specified by the
'url' parameter in the request body on the current machine.

I made this to easily open pages on one machine and carry on reading them on
another.

## Warning

It's not even slightly secure, so make sure you are careful about what IP you
listen on.

## Requirements

The only requirement is Flask. I use the app with Python 2.7 but it might run on
3.x.
